# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
In this project, I will utilize raw e-commerce data in order to extract valuable business information as the ultimate goal. 
I will start by loading data into a database. I will then clean, transform and analyze the raw data. 
Finally, I will develop and implement a QA process, and extract conclusions from the SQL database.

## Process
### Step 1: Loading csv Files into Database
### Step 2: Data Cleaning
### Step 3: Analyze raw data and then tranform data
### Step 4: Extract Conclusions from the sql database

## Results
This data could tell me purchasing patterns for the existing customer base.
I discorvered that the highest level of transactions were from the United States
Also, that most customers ordered 1 product, of which the preponderance was Nest products. 
Shockingly, only roughly 0.55% of unique customers on the site actually purchased something on the site.

## Challenges 
Data wrangling, namely the initial import of the csv files took the most time, because certain import methods with pgadmin did not work, so significant time was spent figuring out what import methods worked - namely moving the data to a c:\temp drive and using the using the COPY command and the query window in pgadmin.

## Future Goals
I would figure out what cities in the united states are most popular (currently they're undefined). 
Also, increasing unique user's same-visit-purchases from 1 item to 3 or more utiling BOGO methods (Buy One Get One free) and other tactics.
Thirdly, I would figure out where the optimum advertising spend is for the database owner.
