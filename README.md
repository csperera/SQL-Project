# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
In this project, I will utilize raw e-commerce data in order to extract valuable business information as the ultimate goal. 
I will start by loading data into a database. I will then clean, transform and analyze the raw data to extract conclusions from the SQL database. 
Finally, I will developing and implement a QA process to validate transformed data against raw data.

## Process
### Step 1: Loading csv Files into Database
### Step 2: Data Cleaning
### Step 3: Analyze raw data and then tranform data
### Step 4: Extract Conclusions from the sql database

## Results
This data could tell me purchasing patterns for the existing customer base.
I discorvered that the highest level of transactions were from the United States
Also, that most customers ordered 1 product, of which the preponderance was Nest products. 
Shockingly, only roughly 0.5% of unique customers on the site actually purchased something.
